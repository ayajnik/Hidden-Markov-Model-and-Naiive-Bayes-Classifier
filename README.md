# Hidden-Markov-Model-and-Naiive-Bayes-Classifier

Forecasting with digits is a way of finding the nature of future events. But today with the advent of Internet of Things and presence of textual data,
it is also important to find an alternative method to find future events with the available data.

In this app, we are using Hidden Markov Model where we first train our model on our desired text file and then generate the next 20 words in 
the sequence. Therefore, creating the next line.

After that we use Naiive Bayes Classifier, and predict what kind of a sale this generated line is, i.e., simple or bundle.
